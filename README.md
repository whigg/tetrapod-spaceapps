ICESat-2 photon datas are used to detecting landslide  

# WHY ?
In our world there is alot of trouble with natural disaster. 
They cause severe damage to artifects and destroy human lifes.
One of this natural disaster called landslide.

# HOW? 
We compared returned photon datas according to their confidence 

At Graph 2 lanslide threat level is more than Graph 1 
results are calculating by returned photon frequency
